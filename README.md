# Estimates output files
The program code estimates parameters (curvature of Constant Relative Risk Aversion, CRRA) utility function, r, 
and tolerance to dropdowns, theta based on the subject decisions over 10 rounds of the app.
Noise in decisions, nu, is estimated as well as measure of persistence in individual decisions
Loss aversion parameter lambda is introduced but not estimated: for practical reasons: it unclear now it can be used.

Translation of preferences over volatilities of the chosen portfolios and risk aversion parameters is not well defined,
Hence risk aversion estimates should be treated as ordinal measures. Translation of these measures to actual portfolios 
remains to be specified.

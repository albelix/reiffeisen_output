# Estimates output files
The program code estimates parameters  based on the subject decisions over 10 rounds of the app:

Curvature of Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function r,

Tolerance to dropdowns, theta,

Noise in decisions estimated as measure of persistence in individual decisions, nu,

Loss aversion parameter lambda is introduced but not estimated, inter alia, for practical reasons: it unclear now it can be used.

Translation of preferences over volatilities of the chosen portfolios and risk aversion parameters is not well defined.

Hence risk aversion estimates should be treated as ordinal measures. Translation of these measures to actual portfolios 
remains to be specified.
